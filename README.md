This repository gathers together various components to create a standalone computer to operate a DIY CNC router.  The computer is mostly off-the-shelf components but in a custom 3D-printed case and uses a small custom PCB to implement a soft-power switch to help with proper computer shutdown.  

The project includes:  
	- A sealed case with thermal management containing a Raspberry Pi and Display  
	- A ventilated case with a fan containing a Raspberry Pi and Display  
	- A step model for the given touch-display  
	- Instructions for loading and configuring UGS on Raspbian OS  
	- A custom PCB to implement a soft-power switch  
	- Code to implement the soft-power switch on an ATTiny85
